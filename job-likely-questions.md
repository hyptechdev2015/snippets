```

difficult team member to deal with and what did you
do?
A. We had a system administrator who treated everyone
poorly, especially me, every time someone came over
to his desk to ask him to either fix something or make

our relationship

```
Q. Give me an example of a time where you knew you
might be late on a project or assignment and what
did you do?

may miss the deadline and why. Then, asked for help

he got the other group to step up. We ended up
meeting our deadline and the release was successful. 

v Managers look for an honest assessment and new plan
v Did you deliver?
```

worked

**“Tell me about your current job”**
Don’t criticise the job or your manager or the company. But you do need to say why you’re leaving.
So either “I like it actually, but when I saw YOUR job I just though it looked so much better” or “I
loved it at first but I’ve been doing it for a while now and I’ve run out of challenges, I don’t feel I’m
learning much any more. You still get some, of course, but I feel I could be being stretched more.
I’ve made some noises about that but the company, nice though they are, don’t have anything
suitable for my next step that they can offer me”.

**“What’s your current boss like?”**
Again, nothing critical because they’ll assume (probably rightly) that you’ll do the same to them.
So “Really nice. He/she listens to me, is supportive, delegates well, gives me some good
challenges every now and then so I’m free to get stuck into some good projects and do tings my
own way without being managed much at all (I’m such a good worker!) – not every boss has been
great, for sure, but I do think I’ve got a good one at the moment and I’ll feel a bit sad, verging on
guilty actually, when I leave”. (see how loyal I am!).
“What do you like most about your current job?”
Learning, freedom to get on with it, making customers happy, and the people I work with.

**“What do you like least?”**
Something about wishing the company was even better, in a constructive way: “I quite like it, I like
most of it, ... though I sometimes wish I could make more of a difference, I’d improve some of the
company’s systems if I had the authority at a higher level to do that. And I don’t think we’re brilliant
at customer care and we could automate more of the process (thinking big and caring about
customers)”
“Why are you looking to leave your current job?”
I’ve been doing it for a while now and I feel that my learning curve is levelling off. I still learn a bit
most days but I don’t feel I’m developing as much as I could, if I had a more meaty job to get my
teeth into”.
OR “The job is OK but the future prospects are pretty limited – my boss is only 3 years older than
me, and there’s nothing else really happening / changing in the company, so I just can’t see where
I’m going to go next. I have actually talked about this with my boss and he/she confirmed that that
is pretty much the situation”. (honesty and loyalty)
“What makes you want to work for us?”
Interview Technique by Chris Croft Training

Growth of the company at present, great products, culture and management style, what the
organisation does makes a real difference to people lives / the world, lots of career options and
possibilities, foreign branches as a possible future option (not just travel right now! And definitely
not pay or holiday or sick pay! Or proximity to where you work)
“What makes you want this job in particular?”
The next logical step for me, ready for it, (and it’s not available with my current employer), got the
skills for it, it’s what I’ve always wanted to do – this answer needs to be pretty tailored, e.g. “For a
while now I’ve been frustrated that in my current job we only deal in type A bonds but this job has
type B and type C as well, which will make it fascinating, especially with the recent merger you’ve
had with the US office and the current deregulation trends in the Asian market”.
“What is your biggest strength?”
Ideally this would be something that’s true! And supported by evidence, e.g. “I think / I’m told that
I’m really good at turning around customers who are thinking of leaving, for example we recently
had one where.....” or “I think I’m pretty creative, when it comes to solving problems, for example,
we kept having this problem with xxxxx and I had the idea of yyyyy and since then we’ve not had
any losses and it’s saving us zzzzz $ a week, so creativity is one thing I’d claim I think” Keep it
modest - “I’m told”, “I think”. You could claim two while you’re at it - “Oh yes, I think I’m pretty
organised as well – I have a master list that I check each Friday afternoon, I write everything down,
I’m pretty obsessive about always keeping my promises, I think anyone I work with would tell you
that”.
“Tell me about a weakness that you have”
Aha, this old chestnut! Clearly you don’t want to say you’re crap - “I do sometimes steal things,
and get into fights, oh yes, and I quite often take Mondays off sick with a hangover, I’m sorry but
it’s just how I am!”
The classic answer is “I tend to work too hard” or “I care too much” or “I find it hard to say no to
customers” but I think these are a bit cheesy, and also they could indicate someone who is a bit
high maintenance if they are true! Certainly don’t say “...which tends to stress me out” - don’t
mention stress!
So how about “I like to get things finished, I don’t like loose ends, so I can get a bit impatient with
other people who haven’t kept their promises and done their part of the job – but I’m aware of that
and I’m working on being more diplomatic when I think someone isn’t pulling their weight.”
“Describe an achievement from your current job”
Have a couple ready! You can sneak two rather than one here. And describe what you did, why it
was hard, the effect on the company, ideally in money saved or made - “I noticed that our sales
people were overlapping the customers they were contacting, so I brought in a new sales process,
where we used some special software and monitored the funnel with a weekly meeting, and it
resulted in an increase in sales of 17% which worked out at $188,000 dollars last year.
“What do you like to do in your spare time?”
Don’t lie, because if you say “Reading” they might ask what you’re reading at the moment, or “Oh
really, what’s your favourite sales book?” etc. Ideally you’ll prepare an answer that shows
Interview Technique by Chris Croft Training

teamwork, a bit of achievement and hard work, e.g. rowing in an eight, organising amateur
dramatics, coaching kids rugby, organising charity events etc
“How would your current boss describe you?”
Obviously all good, prepare a list of things that is pretty much true and not too big-headed: “er, well
I guess they’d say I’m organised, I’m sure about that, and good with the team, and customer
focused... er... I think (s)he’d probably say I’m creative too, good at solving problems. Reliable
too I think – certainly I’ve never let him/her down.”
“Where do you want to be in five years’ time?”
I hate this one, it’s so clichéd. Personally I don’t subscribe to the classic answer “Doing YOUR
job”, it’s too cheeky. I prefer “Who knows, maybe doing the same job as long as it’s still interesting
and I’m still learning, or maybe something else within the company, I’d like to get a broad
knowledge of several different areas within the company, I think multi-skilled people are the most
useful”.
